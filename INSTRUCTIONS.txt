Instructions to run the examples

CellRouter is a computational platform implemented in Java and R. The Java source code contains the Flow Network implementations required for trajectory identification. The R code uses results generated by the Java core engine to systematically dissect complex differentiation trajectories.

Overall, the following softwares are required	:
Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) (tested using the Java version 1.8)
R/Bioconductor (tested using R version 3.3.1)
RStudio

Many R packages are required and should be properly installed. They may be installed by using the following commands:

list.of.packages <- c('reshape','reshape2','pheatmap','clusterProfiler','ReactomePA','plotrix','tsne','igraph','ggplot2,"DESeq",'mclust','grid','scde','gplots','genefilter', 'Rtsne', 'DESeq2')
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages, repos=c("http://cran.rstudio.com/", "https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R"))

During the CellRouter analysis, n case of a missing package after running the steps above, please install them by typing:

source('http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R')
biocLite('package_name')


The folder CellRouter contains .jar files with flow network implementation of CellRouter and additional libraries required. Each script has a variable named libdir which should correctly point to this folder. 

In addition, the working directory, defined by the R command setwd(), should be updated accordingly.  The algorithm assumes that a folder named path inside a folder results exists. The directory structure of folders containing the examples already contains the folder results and paths.

The script StemID_BM_CellRouter.R contains the source code required to reproduce the analysis in Figure 1.

The script CellRouter_BloodNet.R contains the source code required to reproduce the analysis in Figure 2.

The scripts CellRouter_MixedStates.R and CellRouter_Mesoderm.R contain the source code required to reproduce the analysis in Supplementary Note 4.  CellRouter_MixedStates.R contains code to reproduce the analysis in Supplementary Figure N4 and N5. CellRouter_Mesoderm.R contains code to reproduce the analysis in Supplementary Figure N6 and N7.
